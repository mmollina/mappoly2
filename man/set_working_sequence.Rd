\title{Create a sequence of markers}
\usage{
set_working_sequence(
  x,
  lg = NULL,
  ch = NULL,
  mrk.names = NULL,
  ind.names = NULL,
  seq.names = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of the class \code{mappoly.sequence}}

\item{arg}{one of the following input types:
\enumerate{
\item A string 'all': Generates a sequence with all markers from the raw data.
\item A string or a vector of strings 'chrX': Specifies a chromosome (with 'X'
being the chromosome number). For unassigned markers, use 'chr0'.
\item A vector of integers: Indicates the position of markers in the original
data set to be included in the sequence.
\item A vector of strings: Indicates the names or identifiers of the genetic
markers
\item An integer: Represents a linkage group when xect is of class
\code{mappoly.group}.
\item NULL: Applicable when \code{xect} belongs to one of the following
classes: \code{mappoly.pcmap}, \code{mappoly.pcmap3d},
\code{mappoly.unique.seq}, or \code{mappoly.geno.ord}.
}}

\item{info.parent}{one of the following options:
\enumerate{
\item \code{'all'}{select all dosage combinations in both parents (default)}
\item \code{'P1'}{select informative markers parent 1}
\item \code{'P2'}{select informative markers parent 2}
}}

\item{genomic.info}{An optional argument applicable only to \code{mappoly.group}
objects, which can be either NULL or a numeric combination of sequences
from genomic information used to create the sequences:
\enumerate{
\item NULL (default): Returns a sequence containing all markers as defined by
the grouping function.
\item 1: Returns a sequence with markers that match the intersection between
the grouping function and genomic information, considering the genomic information
sequence with the maximum number of matching markers for the group.
\item c(1, 2): Returns a sequence with markers that match the intersection between
the grouping function and genomic information, considering the two genomic
information sequences with the maximum number of matching markers for the group,
and so on.
}}

\item{thresh.line}{position of a threshold line for p values of the segregation test (default = \code{0.05/n.mrk})}

\item{...}{currently ignored}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{mappoly2.sequence}, which is a
list containing the following components:
\item{mrk.names}{}
\item{phases}{}
\item{redundant}{}
\item{data}{}
}
\description{
Makes a sequence of markers based on an object of another class.
