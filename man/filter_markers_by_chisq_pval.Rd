\title{Filter Markers Based on Chi-Squared Test P-Values}
\usage{
filter_markers_by_chisq_pval(x, chisq.pval.thresh = NULL, plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{mappoly2.data} object containing genetic data.}

\item{chisq.pval.thresh}{A numeric threshold for chi-squared test p-values in markers.
If NULL (default), the threshold is set using a Bonferroni approximation.}

\item{plot}{Logical, if TRUE (default), generates a plot showing the distribution of chi-squared p-values.}
}
\value{
Returns the input \code{mappoly2.data} object with markers not meeting the chi-squared p-value threshold removed.
}
\description{
Filters markers in a \code{mappoly2.data} object based on chi-squared test p-values for segregation distortion.
Optionally, generates a plot showing the distribution of chi-squared p-values and indicates which markers were filtered out.
}
\details{
The function filters out markers with chi-squared p-values less than the specified threshold, indicating significant segregation distortion. If \code{plot = TRUE}, it generates a plot of the log10-transformed p-values, indicating which markers were kept or filtered out.
}
\examples{
filtered_data <- filter_markers_by_chisq_pval(genetic_data, chisq.pval.thresh = 0.01, plot = TRUE)
